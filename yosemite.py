Multi-step forecast
To predict multiple steps into the future, we could 'unroll' our single-step model, by predicting a step ahead, adding the forecasted value to our data, and then forecasting the next step until we reach the horizon we are interested in. However, there is a better way to do this: We can directly forecast multiple steps ahead with NeuralProphet.

We can set n_forecasts to the desired number of steps we would like to forecast (also known as 'forecast horizon'). NeuralProphet will forecast n_forecasts steps into the future, at every single step. Thus, we have n_forecasts overlapping predictions of vaying age at every historic point.

When icreasing the forecast horizon n_forecasts, we should also increase the number of past observations n_lags to at least the same value.

Here, we forecast the next 3 hours based on the last observed 6 hours, in 5-minute steps:

Larger forecast horizonÂ¶
For predictions further into the future, you could reduce the resulution of the data. Using a 5-minute resolution may be useful for a high-resolution short-term forecast, but counter-productive for a long-term forecast. As we only have a limited amount of data (approx 2 months), we want to avoid over-specifying the model.

As an example: If we set the model to forecast 24 hours into the future (nforecasts=24*12) based on the last day's temperatures (n_lags=24*12), the number of parameters of our AR component grows to 24*12*24*12 = 82,944. However, we only have about 2*30*24*12 = 17,280 samples in our dataset. The model would be overspecified.

If we first downsample our data to hourly data, we reduce our dataset to 2*30*24=1440 and our model parameters to 24*24=576. Thus, we are able to fit the model. However, it would be better to collect more data.
